## My short story

üë®‚Äçüéì I graduated from university in 2020 and have a Bachelor's degree in the Computer Science.
I consider myself a self-taught developer since I learned most of the stuff outside of my studies.
During my studies, I started to do a Freelance projects in the Web development and automating various web tasks using `Python`.

I got my first project from Fiverr in yearly 2015, it was a _5$_ project to write a simple automation script using `Imacros + JavaScript`.
YES, this is the first money I got from Freelancing it was very exciting to earn your first bucks on the internet.
Back in the day, Imacros was a popular extension for `Chrome` and `Firefox` that was able to record simple activities in the browser.
To extend Imacros abilities I used `JavaScript` for more complex scripts and since then I have moved to `Python` for creating more robust automation scripts.
I wrote a lot of scripts for E-commerce websites, to parse products and upload them into a dashboard.
Besides web scraping, I developed websites using `WordPress` at an early stage and build few websites using `JS/JQuery` and `PHP`.

## Hobbies

Besides tech stuff, I like to run long distances. My longest distance is 21 km.
üí™ I lift weights and trying to learn some basics [Calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics) moves.
I used to play basketball and still love it, but haven't played seriously it for years.
